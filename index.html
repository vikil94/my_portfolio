                the game in a large,
                dark room wearing custom-designed, LED-powered suits. Once the game begins, each suit begins to pulse with one
                of two
                colours, dividing the players into two teams. Participants must attempt to tag players on the other team. The
                game ends
                when all players are the same colour, or when the time has run out.</p>

                demons, players can choose to fight the demons on their own level or superpunch the demon to their partners. The
                game uses PS4 controllers to play. The main focus of this project was to implement the game logic properly while
                the focus on animation came after we had properly figured out the logic </p>
